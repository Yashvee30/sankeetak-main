        <h2>Welcome to Sankeetak!</h2>
        <p class="typing-effect">
            Welcome to Sankeetak, an innovative solution designed to bridge communication gaps through advanced technology. Our platform leverages real-time keypoint and object detection algorithms to provide seamless translation of Indian Sign Language into English and other Indian languages. By utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques, Sankeetak captures and interprets sign language gestures with remarkable accuracy and speed. This real-time translation capability allows individuals within the deaf and hard-of-hearing community to engage in fluid, meaningful conversations, overcoming traditional language barriers and fostering better communication and understanding.</p>
    <br><br>
        <p class="typing-effect">In addition to real-time translation, Sankeetak offers robust support for non-real-time conversions. Our platform is equipped to handle image-based gestures, converting them into text and vice versa. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where immediate translation is not required, such as translating signs captured in photos or converting written text into sign language. By supporting both real-time and non-real-time modes, Sankeetak ensures flexibility and accessibility, accommodating various communication needs and enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
    <br><br>
        <p class="typing-effect">Sankeetak is more than just a tool—it's a step towards a more inclusive and connected world. Our mission is to empower individuals by removing language barriers and fostering greater understanding across communities. Whether used in educational settings, social interactions, or professional environments, Sankeetak aims to make communication more accessible and effective. We invite you to explore our platform and join us on this transformative journey towards a world where language barriers are no longer a hurdle, but an opportunity for greater connection and inclusivity.</p>
